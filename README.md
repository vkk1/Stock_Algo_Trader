# üìà StockTrader: MACD Buy/Sell Signal Analyzer

**StockTrader** is a Python script that analyzes historical stock price data using the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator to generate **buy** and **sell** signals. It evaluates the accuracy of each type of signal and visualizes them using `matplotlib`. Data is fetched from the [Polygon.io API](https://polygon.io/), and signals are calculated and plotted for any selected stock ticker.

> ‚ú® Example: Analyze MACD strategy for **NFLX** between March 18‚Äì30, 2024.
